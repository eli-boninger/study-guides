# study-guides

These study guides are intended as interview prep for frontend/web developers with a knowledge of the basics, but looking to brush up on the type of questions that usually come up in interviews - questions typically related to edge cases, performance/optimizations, and more advanced features of languages and frameworks.

The words and language in these guides are largely ripped directly from existing docs and other articles/sites. I do not claim any of these words as my own - this study guide is intended only as a useful resource, not for my own or anyone else's profit.
